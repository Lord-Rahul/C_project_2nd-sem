# C Projects - Second Semester

This repository contains two C programming projects completed during my second semester of college. The projects are designed to demonstrate basic programming concepts, including input/output handling, file operations, and basic data structures.

## Projects

### 1. Menstrual Cycle Calculator
A C program designed to calculate the menstrual cycle based on user input. The program helps in determining the most fertile days and predicting the next cycle date.

**Features:**
- Input for start date and cycle length
- Calculation of fertile days and next period
- Simple text-based interface

### 2. Bank Management System
A C program that simulates the operations of a basic bank management system, such as creating an account, depositing money, withdrawing money, and viewing account details.

**Features:**
- Account creation with initial balance
- Deposit and withdrawal functionality
- View balance and transaction history
- Transfer and Recieve Functionality
- Login Functionality
- File handling for saving account data

## Technologies Used

- **C Programming**: Core language for both projects
- **File Handling**: For saving account data in the Bank Management System
- **Basic Logic**: Includes conditionals, loops, and functions for both projects


## How to Run the Projects

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Lord-Rahul/C_project_2nd-sem.git
```
Navigate to the project folder.

Compile the code (for each project separately):
```
gcc menstrual_cycle_calculator.c -o menstrual_cycle_calculator
gcc bank_management_system.c -o bank_management_system
```

Run the compiled program:
```
./menstrual_cycle_calculator
./bank_management_system
```
Follow the on-screen instructions for user interaction.
